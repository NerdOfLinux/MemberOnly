# MemberOnly
## Works on latest WordPress version(currently 4.8.2)
I needed a solution to create a member only category in WordPress, and if a post is assigned to it, to block access to not signed in users. Although there are other plugins to restrict actions, if a post has multiple categories, they won't do anything. I created this plugin to fix that.
