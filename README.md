# MemberOnly
## Works on latest WordPress version(currently 4.8.1)
I needed a solution to create a member only category in WordPress, and if a post is assigned to it, to block access to not signed in users. Although there are other plugins to restrict actions, if a post has multiple categories, they won't do anything. I created this plugin to fix that.

Just upload it as a WordPress plugin and configure it.

To make your own plugin, I suggest these guides(the ones I think I used):
