# MemberOnly
I needed a solution to create a member only category in WordPress, and if a post is assigned to it, to block access to not signed in users. Although there are other plugins to restrict actions, if a post has multiple categories, they won't do anything. I created this plugin to fix that. 

Thank you to:

and the other hundred Stack Overflow questions and answers that helped me with coding this.

Here's the zip file:

Just upload it as a WordPress plugin and configure it.
